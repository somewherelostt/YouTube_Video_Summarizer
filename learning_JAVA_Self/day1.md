# Java Learning Journey - Day 1

## About the Journey

I am learning Java as part of my preparation for object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in college exams. For this, I’m following **Bro Code’s Java tutorials** and using **IntelliJ IDEA** as the IDE. I’m managing my progress by creating and updating this README file day by day, pushing changes directly through VS Code.

### Resources

1. **Bro Code Lecture** (Day 1 Reference): [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/xTtL8E4LzTQ?feature=shared)
2. **Bro Code OOP Playlist** (by a random YouTuber): [YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxuuH5GnCIlcGnesYMkGQOqokyI2Fwu3g&feature=shared)

This README will cover both lab exercises and theoretical concepts, with references from Bro Code and additional internet resources.

5. **Using Comments**  
   Adding single-line and multi-line comments for better code readability:  
   Single-line comments:  
   ![comments](image-5.png)  
   Multi-line comments:  

   ```java
   /*
      This is a multi-line comment
   */
   ```

6. **Shortcut in IntelliJ IDEA**  
   Use the shortcut `sout + TAB` to quickly generate a `System.out.println` line in IntelliJ IDEA.
